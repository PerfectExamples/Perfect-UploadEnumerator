# Upload Enumerator
This example illustrates how to extract file upload information from a request. The project consists of only a server component which generates HTML that can be viewed in your browser.

To use the example with Swift Package Manager, type ```swift build``` and then run ``` .build/debug/UploadEnumerator```.

To use the example with Xcode, run the **Upload Enumerator** target. This will launch the Perfect HTTP Server. 

Navigate in your web browser to [http://localhost:8181/](http://localhost:8181/)

## Server Operations
1. The server module consists of two relevent files:
	* **UploadHandler.swift**, within which is the `PerfectServerModuleInit` function, which all Perfect Server modules must implement, and the `UploadHandler` class, which implements the `PageHandler` protocol.
	* **index.mustache**, which contains the template for the HTML based response data.
2. When the **Upload Enumerator** target is built in Xcode it places the resulting product in a directory called **PerfectLibraries**. When the Perfect Server is launched, it will look in this directory, based on the current process working directory, and load all the modules it finds calling the `PerfectServerModuleInit` function in each.
3. When the **Upload Enumerator** target is built in Xcode it also copies the **index.mustache** file into the directory named **webroot**. This permits the file to be treated as the default page for the site.
4. `PerfectServerModuleInit` adds a route for the root of the web server, associating with it a closure which will be called to handle each request.
5. When a request comes in targetting the root of the server, the server will parse the **index.mustache** file.
6. The server calls the `UploadHandler.valuesForResponse` function, which is part of the `MustachePageHandler` protocol, passing to it the request's `MustacheEvaluationContext` and `MustacheEvaluationOutputCollector` objects which contain all the information pertaining to the request. The return value of the `valuesForResponse` function is a Dictionary object populated with the keys and values used when processing the mustache template. The result of the template processing is the resulting data which will be sent back to the client.
7. The handler accesses the `WebRequest.fileUploads` property. This is an array containing one `MimeReader.BodySpec` object for each file which was uploaded. These `BodySpec` objects contain the following:
	* field name
	* file name
	* file size
	* file content type (as determined by the browser which submitted the file)
	* local temporary file name
	* the `File` object containing the locally written file data
8. The handler iterates over each uploaded file and stores the related information into a dictionary. These dictionary values will be utilized in the mustache template which constitutes the resulting HTML data.
9. The handler then iterates over all non-file related parameters which were submitted by the browser. The names and values for each parameter are placed in their own dictionaries. In the resulting template, both file and non-file related submissions will be shown.
10. Finally, the handler adds a dictionary item for the page "title" and returns the resulting dictionary from its `valuesForResponse` function.
11. The **index.mustache** template first iterates over the supplied `{{#files}}` elements, outputting each piece of uploaded file related data into a table. It then iterates over the non-file `{{#params}}` and prints them in a list. The resulting completed HTML data is then returned to the browser.

## Repository Layout

We have finished refactoring Perfect to support Swift Package Manager. The Perfect project has been split up into the following repositories:

* [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) - This repository contains the core PerfectLib and will continue to be the main landing point for the project.
* [PerfectTemplate](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectTemplate) - A simple starter project which compiles with SPM into a stand-alone executable HTTP server. This repository is ideal for starting on your own Perfect based project.
* [PerfectDocs](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectDocs) - Contains all API reference related material.
* [PerfectExamples](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectExamples) - All the Perfect example projects and documentation.
* [PerfectEverything](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectEverything) - This umbrella repository allows one to pull in all the related Perfect modules in one go, including the servers, examples, database connectors and documentation. This is a great place to start for people wishing to get up to speed with Perfect.
* [PerfectServer](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectServer) - Contains the PerfectServer variants, including the stand-alone HTTP and FastCGI servers. Those wishing to do a manual deployment should clone and build from this repository.
* [Perfect-Redis](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Redis) - Redis database connector.
* [Perfect-SQLite](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-SQLite) - SQLite3 database connector.
* [Perfect-PostgreSQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-PostgreSQL) - PostgreSQL database connector.
* [Perfect-MySQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MySQL) - MySQL database connector.
* [Perfect-MongoDB](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MongoDB) - MongoDB database connector.
* [Perfect-FastCGI-Apache2.4](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-FastCGI-Apache2.4) - Apache 2.4 FastCGI module; required for the Perfect FastCGI server variant.

The database connectors are all stand-alone and can be used outside of the Perfect framework and server.
